# OpenShot SDK for Go

Hello! This sdk provides an easy-to-use go interface for the [OpenShot Cloud API](http://cloud.openshot.org/doc/index.html).
I've yet to write up any documentation, however, this sdk was purpose-built for [this project](https://github.com/Bimde/fancam-generator/), so it's a great place to look for code samples.
In particular, check out [this package](https://github.com/Bimde/fancam-generator/tree/master/backend/src/trackingconverter). The tests for each file are also quite thorough and can be used as examles.
