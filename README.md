# OpenShot SDK for Go
Hello! This sdk provides an easy-to-use go interface for the [OpenShot Cloud API](http://cloud.openshot.org/doc/index.html).

## Installation
`go get github.com/Bimde/openshot-sdk-go/openshot`

## How to Use
Add `import "github.com/Bimde/openshot-sdk-go/openshot"` to your file.

I've yet to write up any code samples, however, since this sdk was purpose-built for [this project](https://github.com/Bimde/fancam-generator/), it's a great place to look for example usages. In particular, check out [this package](https://github.com/Bimde/fancam-generator/tree/master/backend/src/trackingconverter). The tests for this package are also quite thorough and can be used as examples.
